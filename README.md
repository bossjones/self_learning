Self Learning 
=============

This tree contains source code I have written whilst learning the craft of
programming. Categorized by topic, with each topic containing various text books
and/or programming projects. I have attempted to attribute all source files that
were typed directly from texts to their respective authors in the first line of
the code. Attribution is generally given in the source files only (not the
headers). However, many files contain lines of code, or whole functions, taken
directly from a book (generally within the category being worked on). This has
been done on the path of knowledge and I believe is within the spirit with with
which the texts were written. I am sincerely grateful to the authors of these
texts by the opportunity to study them.
