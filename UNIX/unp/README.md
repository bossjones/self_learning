UNIX Network Programming

This tree contains source code and answers created whilst studying the above text.

Source code from the text was downloaded from http://www.unpbook.com

An author comment line has been added at the top of each C source file that was
downloaded. If non-trivial modifications have been made (by myself) then
'T. Harding' has been appended to author list.

Completed exercises are sorted by directory, named by chapter (e.g ex-ch1/).

If downloaded source files have been modified to complete an exercise then a
suffix (e.g -ex-5.9) has been appended to the file name (before the .c) and the
pathname to the original file is in the comments. One can then easily 'diff'
with the original file to see additions made.

Sincere gratitude to the authors.
